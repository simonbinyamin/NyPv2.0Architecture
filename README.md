# Requirement and problem
* While (Cosmos DB) is a distributed, multi-model database service that is easier to scale, the costs and lack of competence to maintain this model are two of the main drawbacks
* The backend application is a .NET app that has a soultion containing multiple services and even a SPA frontend build with Angular but running on IIS.
* Cyclic dependencies between the services
